Most users are expected to use a released version of the operator, but if you're
testing or want to use a pre-released version of of the release yamls, you may
want to build your own copy of the operator.

## Installing from source

You can install the Knative Operator from the source code using the
[ko](https://github.com/google/ko) build tool.

1. Download the source code:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/knative/operator.git
   ```

1. Install the Operator in the root directory of the source:

   ```
   ko apply -f config/
   ```

1. To verify the installation:

   ```
   kubectl get deployment
   ```

   The following result indicates the installation is fine:

   ```
   NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   knative-operator   1/1     1            1           17m
   operator-webhook   1/1     1            1           17m
   ```

1. Check the log via the command:

   ```
   kubectl logs -f deploy/knative-operator
   ```

## Release yamls

The operator bundles the last N=4 releases of Knative components in
`/cmd/operator/kodata/` in various subdirectories. A few notes:

- The `kodata` files can be automatically regenerated by running
  `./hack/update-codegen.sh` or the `cmd/fetcher` command; it has a
  configuration for fetching updates in its own `kodata` directory.

- If you only want to update the yaml files, you can also mount a volume over
  `/var/run/kodata` (or set `$KO_DATA_PATH`) on the operator to pick up
  different yaml files. You can combine this with a `ReadWriteMany` volume (or a
  sidecar) to be able to update the yaml files live on-cluster without
  rebuilding the operator image.

## To run the unit tests:

```
go test -v ./...
```

## To run the integration tests:

First, install the Knative Operator. The integration tests use two environment
variables: `TEST_NAMESPACE` for Knative Serving tests and
`TEST_EVENTING_NAMESPACE` for Knative Eventing tests.

```
export TEST_NAMESPACE=knative-serving
export TEST_EVENTING_NAMESPACE=knative-eventing
```

You can choose any names, but the Knative Serving and Knative Eventing should
have different namespaces.

Create the namespaces:

```
kubectl create namespace $TEST_NAMESPACE
kubectl create namespace $TEST_EVENTING_NAMESPACE
```

All the integration tests are tagged with `e2e`. Run the integration tests for
Knative Serving and Eventing:

```
go test -v -tags=e2e -count=1 ./test/e2e
```

You should get all the tests passed, which means your installation is
successful. If you run into any issues, log your issues
[here](https://github.com/knative/operator/issues).

## To run the upgrade tests:

The upgrade tests have taken everything into account. You do not even need to
install Knative Operator or Istio before running the tests. Make sure you have
set two of these environment variables: `TEST_NAMESPACE` and
`TEST_EVENTING_NAMESPACE`.

```
export TEST_NAMESPACE=knative-serving
export TEST_EVENTING_NAMESPACE=knative-eventing
```

IMPORTANT: Before running ANY upgrade tests, run the following commands to clean
up the existing resources:

```
kubectl delete KnativeServing --all -n $TEST_NAMESPACE
kubectl delete KnativeEventing --all -n $TEST_EVENTING_NAMESPACE
```

Run the upgrade tests for the Serving and Eventing CRs:

```
go test -v -tags=upgrade -count=1 ./test/upgrade
```

# Knative Operator Development

Most of the same tools required for
[Knative Serving development](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md)
are required for the operator, too.

You'll probably need to
[install Istio](https://knative.dev/docs/install/installing-istio/). For the e2e
tests to pass, you only need its CRD's.

You should clone this repo to `$GOPATH/src/knative.dev/operator`. All commands
below are relative to that path.

To install the operator:

```
ko apply -f config/
```

To run the unit tests:

```
go test -v ./...
```

To run the e2e tests:

```
ko apply -f config/
kubectl create namespace knative-serving
kubectl create namespace knative-eventing
go test -v -tags=e2e -count=1 ./test/e2e
```
